# Numbered List Formatter ðŸ”¢

This React project is designed to quickly convert non-numbered lists into numbered ones. I built this tool to address a repetitive task: when copying a list of names from Google Sheets, it doesnâ€™t include numbering, which I often need for reports. This tool automatically numbers each item, saving time and reducing manual work.

**Features:**
- Easily convert any text list into a numbered format.
- User-friendly interface that allows for quick pasting and formatting.
- Provides a copy option to easily transfer the formatted list back to your clipboard.

This tool simplifies the process, allowing you to produce a properly numbered list with just one click.
